  A Naira Marley look-alike has threatened to beat up the singer for accusing
  him of impersonation. The young man bears an uncanny resemblance to the singer
  and for a split second one could actually get carried away thinking its the
  real Naira Marley. He has the singer’s same exact looks with his hairstyle,
  face, and gait. However,  it appears his resemblance seems to more of a curse
  than a blessing as the “Soapy” singer accused him of impersonation and that
  did not go too well with him.  The young man which happens to be from Abraka,
  Delta State, Nigeria took to social media and vowed to break his leg if he
  ever comes to his hood. The young man also blasted the singer for claiming
  that he doesn’t know him and revealed that never for once has used his
  resemblance to the singer to extort money from people.   See the video below;
