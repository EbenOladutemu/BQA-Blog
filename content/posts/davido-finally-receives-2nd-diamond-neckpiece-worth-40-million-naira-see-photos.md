## **Davido has finally received his second neckpiece from Icebox in Atlanta and its price is mind-blowing.**

The singer known to spare no expense when it comes to expensive jewelry took to the gram to share videos of him collecting his latest piece. You would recall that Davido last month received one from the popular jewelry store in Atlanta but still had to wait for the second piece to be finished.

Well, it appears the baby is finally ready. The piece which costs a whopping sum of $112,00o (appropriately N40,320,00) has the 30 billion Gang logo encrusted with thousands of diamond pieces and also has a little airplane attached to it. Davido made sure to rock the piece well for his fans and at the same time showed off his total collection.
