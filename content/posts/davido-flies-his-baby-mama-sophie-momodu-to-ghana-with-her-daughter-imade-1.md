Should this be happening? or is this one of the essence of co-parenting, even when one of the partners is married? Davido is flying his baby mama, Sophie Momodu on his private jet down to Ghana while his wife, Chioma is still in London. I am not sure if Chioma will approve of this kind of arrangement because what is the assurance that Davido will not get carried away and impregnate Sophie for a second time? This is all too stitched up and comfortable for a blended family like Davido has, what do you think of this arrangement, will Chioma be happy with this?  Checkout both their photos below:
