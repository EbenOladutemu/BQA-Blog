> General [@MBuhari](https://twitter.com/MBuhari?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) is an all-round failure. The economy is worse than he met it. Human rights are much worse than he met them. And our security is the worst it has ever been since the civil war. The Shagari government, that Buhari overthrew, was not this useless![\#BuhariTormentor](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BuhariTormentor?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
