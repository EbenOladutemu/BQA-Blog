## **Gospel artiste, Tope Alabi has responded to those bashing her for dancing in a worldly like manner at a party.**

In a video that has gone viral, the award-wining gospel singer was seen giving “worldly” dance-like moves. According to the Facebook user that shared the video, the gospel artiste now is totally different from we all knew 10 years ago.*“This is Evangelist Tope Alabi oo… What is this world turns to for God sake. The Tope Alabi I knew 10 years ago is totally different from this one. Hmmmm Ogun Esu gbe ‘bon o!”*

However, reacting to the video in a recent interview, the singer stated that she needed to dance at that time. According to her, she was dancing at her father’s burial and added that only people with “spiritual eyes” will understand its true meaning.
