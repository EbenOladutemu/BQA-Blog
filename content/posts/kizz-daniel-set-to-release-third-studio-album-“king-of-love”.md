## **Sensational singer, Kizz Daniel has announced plans to release a new body of work titled “King Of Love” this year.**

The singer so far has the tw0 albums to his name. “New Era” was released in 2016 and No Bad Songz was released in 2018 and now he is ready to bless his Vado family with a new album. The announcement was made the Kizz himself via his official Twitter page when he wrote,*“New Era (4 years ago) \_\_ No Bad SONGZ ( 2 years ago ) \_\_ King Of Love 2020 #KOL2020.”*

However, the singer is yet to release the date of the album but it is certainly one project to look out for in the year. This is his opportunity to show that he is truly the King of Love as the title suggests.
