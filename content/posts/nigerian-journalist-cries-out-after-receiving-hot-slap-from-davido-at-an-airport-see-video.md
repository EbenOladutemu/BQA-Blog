## **An unidentified journalist is currently in severe pains due to the slap he received from Davido after attempting to hug him.**

According to him, while waiting for one of the artistes he has been promoting at the Airport in Ikeja,Lagos, he saw Davido who happened to be passing by. Not wanting to miss out on taking that golden picture with his idol, he swiftly moved to take a selfie with the “Risky” singer. However, as he approached the singer for a selfie, Davido immediately attacked him by hitting his chest hard.

Taking to social media, he wrote:*On Friday 14th February 2020. I was at the international airport to pick up an artiste I’m promoting. Me been a huge fan of davido, I approached him for a picture: to my uttermost surprised Davido slapped me unprovoked for no reason; I was shocked and utterly embraced, to say the least.*

*I’m a fan and I wouldn’t wanna miss any opportunity to have a picture with my idol, Davido, and nothing hurts me more than attacking me in such a manner. I felt hurt, humiliated in the presence of many people at the scene of the arrival. This is someone I’ve always given preference in my field of entertainment journalism. I have been feeling terrible since then: my chest even hurts.*
