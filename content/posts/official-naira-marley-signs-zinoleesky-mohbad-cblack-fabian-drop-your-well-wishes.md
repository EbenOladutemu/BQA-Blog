**Nigerian rapper Zlatan Ibile is thankful for all the help DMW boss, Davido brought his way since meeting him just last year.**

The rapper, who recently performed at Davido’s concert which was held last night, shared a testimony of how Davido helped him tremendously.

The ‘Yeye Boyfriend’ crooner narrated how he attended Davido’s show last year in a rickety Sienna vehicle which he parked at a distance away from the venue.

He Said:

> “Last year, I was using a stupid Sienna that I had to pack faraway from this venue and had to trek to this event. Thank OBO for changing my life.”
