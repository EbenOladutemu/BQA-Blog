## **Singer,[Reekado Banks](https://tooxclusive.com/tag/reekado-banks/)has reacted to President Trump’s decision to ban Nigerians from immigrating to the US.**

The singer took to his Instagram page to share a video of a popular presenter and activist, Carol Angela Davis slamming Trump on his recent decision to ban Nigerians from immigrating to the US. In the video, she laid out the achievements of Nigerians so far in the country stating that they are the most educated ethnic group in the country. She also added that the majority of the doctors in the country are of Nigerian descendants and thanked them for bringing their talents to the US.

[Reekado Banks](https://tooxclusive.com/tag/reekado-banks/)reacted to the video stating that Nigerians for so long have been labeled as criminals and the most corrupt human being in the world. The “Rora” singer elated by the new way Nigerians are being perceived outside the county urged them never to be deterred by any agenda trying to damage their reputation.

In his words, “*The unpopular truth about Nigeria.When the truth is slightly bent, it becomes hard to detect just how toxic the result would be. This is the Nigerian story. For so many years, Nigeria has been afflicted by the sting of a false narrative that is led by labels of crime, corruption and everything else that is distasteful. This negative agenda has been pushed so consistently that many Nigerians have even embraced it as true.*

*Never again! My people are not liabilities, my people are assets to the global community and the fruits of our resilience and work ethic is evident. The Nigerian spirit will never be disoriented by any damaging agenda. We will continue to hoist our flag, and amplify the authentic and true Nigerian story ????”*
