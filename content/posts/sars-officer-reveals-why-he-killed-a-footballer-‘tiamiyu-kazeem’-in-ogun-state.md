Fresh Statement from the SARS Officer who was alleged to have killed a footballer Tiamiyu Kazeem in Ogun State

In the video, t9ja [g](https://globalnewsng.com/)earnt that the SARS officer who is now looking as gentle as they should actually look when they are on duty was seen trying to dribble is way out of the corners after he was looped in by the asker.

Unfortunately, The Remo Star, a professional football club assistant captain is gone and it is left to be seen if a worthy judgement will come out of this.
