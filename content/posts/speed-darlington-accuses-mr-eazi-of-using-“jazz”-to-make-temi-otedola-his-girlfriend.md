## **Nigerian singer and Instagram sensation, Speed Darlington wants to know the kind of voodoo Mr Eazi used in getting Temi Otedola to date him.**

The singer took to his Instagram page to share a video of the love birds acting all cuter on Valentine’s day and called out Mr Eazi for using voodoo on Temi. According to him, he has been trying to reach out to her older sister, Cuppy but she has refused to respond to him. He added that he has been planning to use voodoo to trap one of the billionaire daughters but Mr Eazi’s relationship with Temi has destroyed his plans.

He wrote: *“Bro seriously which country is your voodoo priest in? I’m willing to blow 100,000 naira on a voodoo priest to help me land a rich man daughter eating off my hands. What is it you got that she can’t get enough of? relevancy is like 1000 miles away from you and she still stay even though you are on nobodies list.*

*How many songs have you drop this year my friend already dropped two I have dropped one another one coming on my birthday three weeks from now. I am trying so hard to see your hotness it’s it’s very hard. I have been giving signal to the older sister and still refuse to receive it I’m running out of shots to shoot So I have to resort to voodoo Priest, I must tie one of them.”*
