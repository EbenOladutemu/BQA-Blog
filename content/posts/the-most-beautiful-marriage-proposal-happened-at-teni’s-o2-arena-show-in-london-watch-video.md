Teni made her debut at the O2 Arena in Brixton, London, UK on the 23rd of February, 2020 and it was one for the books. Teni released her first single of the year “Marry” last week which talks about how ladies struggle to get married in the country. The song which is meant to preach awareness for such struggles served as the soundtrack for a beautiful proposal that happened at her show.

The proposal which happened to one of the highlights of the show started when the unidentified lady was called on stage by the singer. A while later, Teni asked her to turn and she saw her husband-to-be down on one knee.
