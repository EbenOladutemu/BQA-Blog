## **Wizkid has paid tribute to a die-hard fan of his who shared disturbing messages on death and died afterwards.**

The young man identified as Dolapo took to his Twitter page to share disturbing messages about death. Unfortunately, Dolapo died shortly after the tweet and the entire Twitter community was thrown into mourning. Friends to the deceased called the attention of the “Fever” singer and revealed that he was a die-hard fan and that his one wish was to be acknowledged by him.

Obviously heartbroken, Wizkid paid a tribute to late Dolapo with a message on Twitter. He wrote: “*Rip Dolapo! Broken heartGod bless his soul and I pray God bless the family with the strength at this time Broken heart”*
