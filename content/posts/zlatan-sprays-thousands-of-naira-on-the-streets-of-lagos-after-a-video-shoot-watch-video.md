## **Sensational singer, Zlatan wants his fans to know that he has been smiling to the bank.**

In a video that has gone viral, the “Zanku” singer who was without clothes took to the streets with his team to spray wads of cash for his lucky fans. The singer happened to be in the neighborhood for the shoot of his latest song “Unripe Paw Paw” and decided to show his magnanimous side by giving back to the society.

However, some music fans have taken to social media to bash the singer for his actions. Some argued that the singer has zero respect for the naira while some believe the whole act of kindness was unnecessary. What do you think?
