## **Sensational singer, Speed Darlington has finally revealed how living in Lagos left him high and dry.**

The singer who left the country 18 years ago for greener pastures in the US returned to support his foe turned friend, Zlatan. After delivering a superb performance the “Bolanle” crooner’s show, he decided to extend his stay in Nigeria to reconnect with his roots.

However, the singer had difficulties adjusting to living the Nigerian way as he was always caught up in nasty scandals and this made him leave the country. He took to his Instagram page to finally share the reason for leaving the country. According to him, he won’t be moving to Lagos if he ever decides to relocate back to Nigeria.

He stated that he would like to live in Benin or Calabar where life is cheaper. Speedy further disclosed that living in Calabar would be perfect for him as he can secure a house and a maid for just 2 million naira.

He wrote:*“Honestly I don’t know what I’m doing in Lagos maybe I should live in Benin City or Calabar where life is much cheaper and I can get to the capital within 10 hours of driving. With 2 million naira in Calabar i can have a very nice place with a maid. Six weeks in Lagos I only got two jobs that’s not a lot. I don’t have plans of getting married right now but i want a child, outside Lagos, is my best bet.”*
