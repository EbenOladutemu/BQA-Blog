## **Sensational singer, Zlatan has professed his unconditional love for Davido and its nothing but brotherly love.**

Zlatan has joined the plethora of well-wishers that have congratulated the “Risky” singer after his singles and “A Good Time” went platinum. The “Bolanle” singer congratulated Davido with a rather strange message that’s likely to cause on a stir on social media. He wrote,*“Davido you know I love you pass Chioma! More wins God’s favorite.”*

While others have commended him for constantly supporting the singer, others slammed him for suing such words to congratulate the singer.
